:hedgehog: I'm George
---------------------

I make stuff.

Mostly to pay the bills and sometimes for fun.
I've written a lot of Go, primarily for distributed systems.

These days I build [flipt :pirate_flag:](https://github.com/flipt-io/flipt).

Previously, I worked on [InfluxDB :hourglass:](https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb), [Codeship :ship:](https://github.com/codeship), and [Honeycomb TV :bee:](https://github.com/honeycomb-tv).
