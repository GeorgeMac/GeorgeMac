:hedgehog: I'm George
---------------------

I make stuff. Mostly to pay the bills, but sometimes for fun.
I've written a lot of Go, mostly for distributed systems.

These days I build @flipt-io :pirate_flag:

Previously, I worked on @influxdata :hourglass:, @codeship :ship:, and @honeycombtv :bee:.
